### Task

Create a basic web app to allow a user to look up information for Division 1 college football players in the United States.

### Instructions

The app should allow users to search for players by name, team, or position, and display relevant information such as player statistics, team affiliation, and position.

It should also include information about previous schools the player has attended, if applicable. The app should be built using React and TypeScript, and should follow best practices for REST API design and implementation.

Be sure to include NIL (Name, Image, Likeness) information for each player, as well as any other relevant data that may be useful for fans and analysts.

Design the app to be aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly, with a responsive layout that works well on both desktop and mobile devices. Use modern design patterns and libraries to enhance the user experience. Reference the latest versions of Airbnb's and Strava UI/UX design systems for inspiration.

Build the app with scalability in mind, allowing for future expansion to include additional features such as player news, social media integration, and more detailed statistics. Although not necessary for the size of this project, implement a basic containerization strategy using Docker to ensure easy deployment and scalability.

The database design should be flexible enough to accommodate future changes, such as adding new player attributes or expanding the data model to include additional sports or leagues. Prioritize reads over writes and availability over consistency. Keep in mind that real-time data updates may be included in future iterations so design the database schema accordingly.
